# Homework Repository

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various homework assignments related to machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Homework 1: Gradient Descent and Metrics

In this homework, we implemented Gradient Descent algorithm and computed three evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, we discussed strategies for dealing with missing values and visualized correlation matrices for feature separation.

## Homework 2: Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier

The second homework focuses on two classification algorithms: Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier. We explore their theoretical foundations, implementation, and practical applications.

## Homework 3: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest

This homework delves into more advanced machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. We discuss the principles behind each algorithm and provide implementations for classification and regression tasks.

## Homework 4: K-Means and DBSCAN

In the fourth homework assignment, we explore unsupervised learning algorithms: K-Means clustering and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). We discuss their applications, advantages, and limitations.

Each homework directory contains code implementations, documentation, and any additional resources relevant to the assignment.
